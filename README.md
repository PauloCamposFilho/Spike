### Description

### Technical Stack

The app backend is built using Ruby on Rails on top of a PostgreSQL database. Rails was used for two reasons: 
- to save time when considering the information that would be needed from the database for our numerous endpoints (not needing to write extensive queries or procedures to fetch them)
- it was a new technology for the authors at the time and they wanted to challenge themselves by using something that wasn't wholly familiar.

### Dependencies

- Ruby on Rails with Activerecord
  - Faker
- ReactJS
  - Material UI
  - React Router
